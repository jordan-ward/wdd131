            <p>
                Building miniatures allows for creativity to shine. Models come on sheets called sprues. You then cut the pieces off of the sprue and glue them together to create a model. You normally follow the given directions for assembly, but it is not required and even encouraged to make the models your own by adding or not adding details. These models come highly detailed and allow the owner to enjoy what they create.

            <p>
                Painting allows accomplished artists to display their skill. There are recommended paint guides and colors for each model but it is not required to follow. You can make them your own by creating your own color scheme. The details on some of the models provide accomplishment to those with a steady hand and plenty of patience.
