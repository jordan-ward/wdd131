            <h2>About Warhammer</h2>
            <p>
                Warhammer 40,000 is an entertaining hobby that revolves around building miniatures, painting those miniatures, and then playing with them in a wargame scenario with another person. You start off by choosing a faction that interests you then get to building. Each model is assigned points and once your army reaches the desired amount of points, generally 2,000, you are able to go against another person with their own army. The hobby includes a spot for everyone. If you enjoy learning the lore of this fantasy universe, there are many books, animations, and videos out there about it. My personal favorite part of the hobby is the building. I enjoy seeing these highly detailed miniatures come to life!
